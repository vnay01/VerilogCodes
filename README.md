# VerilogCodes
A repository of verilog codes of various digital circuits using Verilog-2001 standard.
Even though, I have used open-source "Icarus verilog" compiler for compiling and simulating the codes, the code should run on any simulation tool(for eg. ModelSim etc.)
Any waveform viewer (for eg. GTKwave etc) can be used to view the generated waveforms.

As for the question as to why am I simulating digital ciruits!?
Short answer- Build and simulate an 8085 micro-processor!

[Note: I may update the final goal to something else!!]
